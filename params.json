{"name":"Jogo Programming Language","tagline":"","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nJogo is a high(er) performance compiled language (like C++) with a clean, powerful syntax (like Python, Lua, or Ruby).  It is designed for programming games and game servers.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* [Quick Tour](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Quick-Tour-of-the-Jogo-Programming-Language)\r\n* [Tutorial](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki)\r\n* [Download and Installation](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Download-and-Installation)\r\n* [Standard Library Reference](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Standard-Library-Reference)\r\n* [Compiler and Tools Manual](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Compiler-and-Tools-Manual)\r\n* [Jogo FAQ](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Jogo-FAQ)\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n* Debian: [jogo-0.3.0.deb](https://jogo-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/jogo-0.3.0.deb)\r\n* OS X: [jogo-0.3.0.pkg](https://jogo-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/jogo-0.3.0.pkg)\r\n* Windows: [jogo-0.3.0.exe](https://jogo-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/jogo-0.3.0.exe)\r\n\r\n## Who started this thing?\r\n\r\nJogo was designed and written by [Matt Fichman](https://github.com/mfichman).\r\n\r\n## How can I contribute?\r\n\r\nI'm looking for help with Jogo.  Starting a new language is a big task.  In particular, I need help writing lots of additional tests, libraries, and compiler back-ends (x86-32 and ARM in particular -- the compiler currently only outputs x86-64).  If you'd like to contribute, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo), add yourself to the [contributors page](https://github.com/mfichman/jogo/wiki/Contributors) and send me a pull request.
