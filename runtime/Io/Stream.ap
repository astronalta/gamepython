StreamStatus = OK | ERROR | EOF
# Encodes the current status of the I/O stream.  OK: Stream is in the normal 
# state and is ready for I/O.  ERROR: The stream is in an invalid state, either
# because a socket or file descriptor is closed, or due to an error raised by
# the underlying file descriptor.  EOF: The stream is at the end of the file,
# and no more bytes may be read.

StreamMode = ASYNC | BLOCKING
# The stream mode manages how I/O is handled by the runtime.  ASYNC: Stream
# read/write operations return immediately, but the I/O operation will not
# finish until later; the wait() function must be called to retrieve the stream
# status.  SYNC: Stream operations block the current coroutine.  BLOCKING:
# Stream operations block the process.  SYNC is the default.  BLOCKING mode is
# not recommended for most applications.

StreamType = FILE | SOCKET | CONSOLE
# The type of underlying file descriptor that is attached to the stream.

Stream < Object {
    # This object is used to perform buffered character I/O on a file.  It can
    # be used to read from any device or input that the OS supports for the
    # underlying handle type, including sockets, files, pipes, etc.

    handle immutable Int
    # Opaque handle to the underlying file descriptor.

    read_buf private Buffer
    # Bytes buffered for input.  The stream buffers input bytes to avoid 
    # invoking a system call for each read.

    write_buf private Buffer
    # Bytes buffered for output.  The stream buffers output bytes to avoid 
    # invoking a system call for each write.

    status StreamStatus
    # The current status of the stream; either OK, ERROR, or EOF.

    mode StreamMode
    # The current mode of the stream, as described above; either SYNC, ASYNC,
    # or BLOCKING.  Controls the type of I/O that will be executed for the 
    # stream.

    type immutable StreamType
    # True if the stream is a console handle
